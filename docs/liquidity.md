Liquidity, a simple language over Michelson
===========================================

Liquidity is a language to program Smart Contracts for Tezos. It uses
the syntax of OCaml, and strictly complies to Michelson security
restrictions.

The [Liquidity Project](http://github.com/OCamlPro/liquidity)
---------------------

The Liquidity project contains:

* A compiler from Liquidity files (.liq extension) to Michelson
* A de-compiler from Michelson files (.tz extension) to Liquidity
* An evaluator of Michelson contracts
* An interface to a Tezos node for manipulating Liquidity contracts

See [examples](http://github.com/OCamlPro/liquidity/tree/master/tests)
in the [Github](http://github.com/OCamlPro/liquidity) project.

Contract Format
---------------

All the contracts have the following form:

```ocaml
[%%version 0.14]

<... local declarations ...>

let%init storage
      (x : TYPE)
      (x : TYPE)
      ... =
      BODY

let%entry main
      (parameter : TYPE)
      (storage : TYPE)
      : TYPE =
      BODY
```

The `version` statement tells the compiler in which version of
Liquidity the contract is written. The compiler will reject any
contract that has a version that it does not understand (too old, more
recent). We expect to reach version 1.0 at the launch of the Tezos
network.

The `main` function is the default entry point for the contract.
`let%entry` is the construct used to declare entry points (there is
currently only one entry point, but there will be probably more in the
future).  The declaration takes two parameters with names
`parameter`, `storage`, the arguments to the function. Their types must
always be specified. The return type of the function must also be
specified by a type annotation.

A contract always returns a pair `(return, storage)`, where `return`
is the return value to the caller, and `storage` is the final state of
the contract after the call. The type of the pair must match the type
of a pair where the first component is the return type of the function
specified in its signature and the second is the type of the argument
`storage` of `main`.

`<... local declarations ...>` is an optional set of optional type and
function declarations. Type declarations can be used to define records
and variants (sum-types), described later in this documentation.

An optional initial storage or storage initializer can be given with
`let%init storage`. When deploying a Liquidity contract, if the
storage is not constant it is evaluated in the prevalidation context.


Types
-----

Types in Liquidity are monomorphic. The built-in base types are:

- `unit`: whose only constructor is `()`
- `bool`: Booleans
- `int`: unbounded integers
- `nat`: unbounded naturals
- `tez`: the type of amounts
- `string`: character strings
- `timestamp`: dates and timestamps
- `key`: cryptographic keys
- `key_hash`: hashes of cryptographic keys
- `signature`: cryptographic signatures

The other types are:

- tuples: noted `(t1 * t2 * t3)`
- option type: `'a option = None | Some of 'a`
- variant type: `('a, 'b) variant = Left of 'a | Right of 'b`
- lists: `'a list` is the type of lists of elements in `'a`
- sets: `'a set` is the type of sets of elements in `'a`
- maps: `('a, 'b) map` is the type of maps whose keys are of type
  `'a` and values of type `'b`
- big maps: `('a, 'b) big_map` is the type of lazily deserialized maps whose
  keys are of type `'a` and values of type `'b`
- contracts: `('a, 'b) contract` for contracts whose parameter is of
  type `'a` and return value if of type `'b`
- functions: `'a -> 'b` is the type of functions from `'a` to `'b`

Record and variant types must be declared beforehand and are referred
to by their names.


Calling another contract
------------------------

Calling another contract is done by using the following form:

```ocaml
let (RESULT, storage) = Contract.call CONTRACT AMOUNT STORAGE ARG
in
BODY
```
where:

- `RESULT` is the identifier of the variable that will receive the value
  returned by the contract;
- `CONTRACT` is the value of the contract being called;
- `AMOUNT` is the value of the amount of Tez sent to the contract;
- `STORAGE` is the value of the storage saved before the call;
- `ARG` is the argument sent to the contract.
- `BODY` is some code to be executed after the contract, using the
  result of the call.

All variables are destroyed during the call, so any state that should
survive the call should be stored in the storage of the calling
contract. It is not a limitation, but a design choice: always
specifying the state at the call forces the programmer to think about
what would happen in the case of a recursive call.

Operators and functions
-----------------------

Here is a list of equivalences between MICHELSON instructions and
Liquidity functions:

* `FAIL` : `Current.fail ()`. Makes the contract abort.
* `SELF` : `Current.contract ()`. Returns the current contract being executed.
* `BALANCE` : `Current.balance ()`. Returns the current balance of the
       current contract.
* `NOW` : `Current.time ()`. Returns the timestamp of the block containing
       the transaction in the blockchain.
* `AMOUNT` : `Current.amount ()`. Returns the amount of tezzies that were
       transfered when the contract was called.
* `STEPS_TO_QUOTA` : `Current.gas ()`. Returns the current gas available
       to execute the end of the contract.
* `SOURCE arg_type res_type` : `(Source : (arg_type, res_type) contract)`.
       Returns the contract that called the current contract.
* `CONS` : `x :: y`
* `NIL ele_type` : `( [] : ele_type list )`
* `H` : `Crypto.hash x`. Returns the hash of its argument, whatever it is.
* `HASH_KEY` : `Crypto.hash_key k`. Compute the b58check of the key `k`.
* `CHECK_SIGNATURE` : `Crypto.check key (signature,data)`. Returns `true` if
     the public key has been used to generate the signature of the data.
* `CREATE_ACCOUNT` : `Account.create`: creates a new account
* `CREATE_CONTRACT` : `Contract.create`: creates a new contract
* `MANAGER` : `Contract.manager ct`: returns the key of the manager of the
     contract in argument
* `EXEC` : `Lambda.pipe x f` or `x |> f` or `f x`, is the application of the
     lambda `f` on the argument `x`.
* `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` : `Account.default key_hash`. Returns the default contract
    (of type `(unit,unit) contract`) associated with a key hash.

Comparison operators
--------------------

These operators take two values of the same type, and return a Boolean value:

* `COMPARE; EQ` : `x = y`
* `COMPARE; NEQ` : `x <> y`
* `COMPARE; LE` : `x <= y`
* `COMPARE; LT` : `x < y`
* `COMPARE; GE` : `x >= y`
* `COMPARE; GT` : `x > y`

The last one returns an integer:

* `COMPARE` : `compare x y`


Operations on data structures
-----------------------------
* `MAP` : `Map.map` or `List.map`
* `GET` : `Map.find`
* `UPDATE`: `Map.update` or `Set.update`
* `MEM`: `Map.mem` or `Set.mem`
* `CONCAT` : `@`
* `REDUCE` : `Map.reduce` or `Set.reduce` or `List.reduce`
* `SIZE` : `List.size` or `Set.size` or `Map.size`
* `ITER` : `List.iter` or `Set.iter` or `Map.iter` or `List.fold` or
  `Set.fold` or `Map.fold`

(it is possible to use the generic `Coll.` prefix for all collections,
but not in a polymorphic way, i.e. `Coll.` is immediately replaced by the
type-specific version for the type of its argument.)

Liquidity also provides additional operations:

* `List.rev : 'a list -> 'a list` : List reversal
* `Map.add : 'a -> 'b -> ('a, 'b) map -> ('a, 'b) map` : add (or
  replace) a binding to a map
* `Map.remove : 'a -> ('a, 'b) map -> ('a, 'b) map` : remove a binding,
  if it exists, in a map
* `Set.add : 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set` : add an element to a set
* `Set.remove : 'a -> 'a set -> 'a set` : remove an element, if it
  exists, in a set

Arithmetic and logic operators
------------------------------

* `OR` : `x || y` or `x lor y`
* `AND` : `x && y` or `x land y`
* `XOR` : `x xor y` or `x lxor y`
* `NOT` : `not x` or `lnot x`
* `ABS` : `abs x` with the difference that `abs` returns an integer
* `INT` : `int x`
* `NEG` : `-x`
* `ADD` : `x + y`
* `SUB` : `x - y`
* `MUL` : `x * y`
* `EDIV` : `x / y`
* `LSR` : `x >> y` or `x lsr y`
* `LSL` : `x << y` or `x lsl y`

For converting `int` to `nat`, Liquidity provides a special
pattern-matching construct `match%nat`, on two constructors `Plus` and
`Minus`. For instance, in the following where `x` has type `int`:

```ocaml
match%nat x with
| Plus p -> p + 1p
| Minus m -> m + 1p
```

`m` and `p` are of type `nat` and:

* `x = int m` when `x` is positive or null
* `x = - (int p)` when `x` is negative


Constants
---------

The unique constructor of type `unit` is `()`.

The two Booleans constants are:

* `true`
* `false`

As in Michelson, there are different types of integers:

* int : an unbounded integer, positive or negative, simply
    written `0`,`1`,`2`,`-1`,`-2`,...
* nat : an unbounded positive integer, written either with a `p` suffix
    (`0p`, `12p`, etc.) or as an integer with a type coercion ( `(0 : nat)` ).
* tez : an unbounded positive float of Tezzies, written either with
    a `tz` suffix (`1.00tz`, etc.) or as a string with type coercion
    (`("1.00" : tez)`).

Strings are delimited by the characters `"` and `"`.

Timestamps are written in ISO 8601 format, like in Michelson:

* `2015-12-01T10:01:00+01:00`

Keys and hashes are base58-check encoded, the same as in Michelson:

* `tz1YLtLqD1fWHthSVHPD116oYvsd4PTAHUoc` is a key hash
* `edpkuit3FiCUhd6pmqf9ztUTdUs1isMTbF9RBGfwKk1ZrdTmeP9ypN` is a public key

Signatures are 64 bytes long hex encoded, prefixed with a backtick:
```
`96c724f3eab3da9eb0002caa5456aef9a7c716e6d6d20c07f3b3659369e7dcf5b66a5a8c33dac317fba6174217140b919493acd063c3800b825890a557c39e0a
```

There are also three types of collections: lists, sets and
maps. Constants collections can be created directly:

* Lists: `["x"; "y"]`;
* Sets: `Set [1; 2; 3; 4]`;
* Maps: `Map [1, "x"; 2, "y"; 3, "z"]`;
* Big maps: `BigMap [1, "x"; 2, "y"; 3, "z"]`;

In the case of an empty collection, whose type cannot be inferred, the
  type must be specified:

* Lists: `([] : int list)`
* Sets: `(Set : int set)`
* Maps: `(Map : (int, string) map)`
* Big maps: `(BigMap : (int, string) big_map)`


Tuples
------

Tuples in Liquidity are compiled to pairs in Michelson:
```
(x, y, z) <=> Pair x (Pair y z)
```

Tuples can be accessed using the field access notation of Liquidity:
```ocaml
let t = (x,y,z) in
let should_be_true = t.(2) = z in
...
```

A new tuple can be created from another one using the field access update
notation of Liquidity:
```ocaml
let t = (1,2,3) in
let z = t.(2) <- 4 in
...
```

Tuples can be deconstructed:
```ocaml
(* t : (int * (bool * nat) * int) *)
let _, (b, _), i = t in
...
(* b : bool
   i : int *)
```


Records
-------

Record types can be declared and used inside a liquidity contract:
```ocaml
type storage = {
  x : string;
  y : int;
}
```
Such types can be created and used inside programs:
```ocaml
let r = { x = "foo"; y = 3 } in
r.x
```

Records are compiled as tuples.

Deep record creation is possible using the notation:
```ocaml
let r1 = { x = 1; y = { z = 3 } } in
let r2 = r1.y.z <- 4 in
...
```

Variants
--------

Variants should be defined before use, before the contract
declaration:

```ocaml
type t =
| X
| Y of int
| Z of string * nat
```

Variants can be created using:

```ocaml
let x = X 3 in
let y = Z s in
...
```

The `match` construct can be used to pattern-match on them, but only
on the first constructor:

```ocaml
match x with
| X -> ...
| Y i -> ...
| Z s -> ...
```

where `i` and `s` are variables that are bound by the construct to the
parameter of the variant.

Parameters of variants can also be deconstructed when they are tuples,
so one can write:
```ocaml
match x with
| X -> ...
| Y i -> ...
| Z (s, n) -> ...
```


A special case of variants is the `Left | Right` predefined variant,
called `variant`:
```ocaml
type (`left, `right) variant =
| Left of `left
| Right of `right
```

All occurrences of these variants should be constrained with type
annotations:

```ocaml
let x = (Left 3 : (int, string) variant) in
match x with
| Left left  -> ...
| Right right -> ...
```

Another special variant is the `Source` variant: it is used to refer to
the contract that called the current contract.

```ocaml
let s = (Source : (unit, unit) contract) in
...
```

As for `Left` and `Right`, `Source` occurrences should be constrained by
type annotations.

Functions and Closures
----------------------

Unlike Michelson, functions in Liquidity can also be closures. They can take
multiple arguments and are curryfied. Because closures are lambda-lifted, it is
however recommended to use a single tuple argument when possible.  Arguments
must be annotated with their (monomorphic) type, while the return type
is inferred.

Function applications are often done using the `Lambda.pipe` function
or the `|>` operator:

```ocaml
  let succ = fun (x : int) -> x + 1 in
  let one = 0 |> succ in
...
```

but they can also be done directly:

```ocaml
...
  let succ (x : int) = x + 1 in
  let one = succ 0 in
...
```

A toplevel function can also be defined before the main entry point:
```ocaml
[%%version 0.14]

let succ (x : int) = x + 1

let%entry main ... =
   ...
   let one = succ 0 in
   ...
```

Closures can be created with the same syntax:
```ocaml
let p = 10 in
let sum_and_add_p (x : int) (y : int) = x + y + p in
let r = add_p 3 4 in
...
```

This is equivalent to:
```ocaml
let p = 10 in
let sum_and_add_p =
  fun (x : int) ->
    fun (y : int) ->
      x + y + p
in
let r = 4 |> (3 |> add_p) in
...
```


Functions with multiple arguments should take a tuple as argument because
curried versions will generate larger code and should be avoided
unless partial application is important. The previous function should
be written as:
```ocaml
let sum_and_add_p ((x : int), (y : int)) =
  let p = 10 in
  x + y + p
in
let r = add_p (3, 4) in
...
```


Loops
-----

Loops in liquidity share some syntax with functions, but the body of
the loop is not a function, so it can access the environment, as would
a closure do:

```ocaml
let end_loop = 5 in
let x = Loop.loop (fun x ->
    ...
    (x < end_loop, x')
  ) x_init
in
...
```

As shown in this example, the body of the loop returns a pair, whose first
part is the condition to remain in the loop, and the second part is the
accumulator.
